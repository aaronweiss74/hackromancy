SrcError
===========

A simple RPG where hacking is magic.  
n.b. This was never finished, and likely never will be finished. It was replaced by a hacked-together Python demo.

Justification
=============
Do you want to do real magic?? 

Are you a programmer who secretly wishes to be a wizard? 

Do you want to learn programming and magic at the same time?

*Well, SrcError is the game for you and everyone you know and everyone else!*
